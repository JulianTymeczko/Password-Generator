# Password Generator
## Languages Used
This challenge uses all three html, css and javascript. However, some starter code is provided which includes the
html and css and some of the javascript. 
## What I Used
I used only javascript to complete the challenge. Using conditional statements such as for loops and if statements, I was 
able to create a way for javasctipt to randomly produce a passwordn based on the prompts that were given.
Many issues arose, howver; with console logs, I was able to debug all of them and ensure that the code is functional and 
concise.
